# Microformat Blocks for WordPress

Very draft. Will change.

## Content Entry (h-entry) block

This block implements an initial attempt at [proper h-entry markup](http://microformats.org/wiki/h-entry).

Toggles are used to include:
* `p-name`
* `p-summary`
* `e-content`
* `dt-published`

To implement next:
* Author cards per entry.
* Permalinks per entry.
* Add `u-in-reply-to` in the style [described by reply-context](https://indieweb.org/reply-context).
